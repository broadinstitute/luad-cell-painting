<h3>What is this about?</h3>
<p class="flow-text">
Clinical sequencing uncovers many variants of unknown significance, especially
in cancer, leaving doctors stuck. We show that cell morphology一specifically,
images of cells stained for various organelles through the Cell Painting
assay一contains sufficient information to determine the impact of many variants
on many genes’ functions.

We collected Cell Painting images of A549 cells for 325 overexpression
constructs of variants found in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) across 50 reference
genes in a high-throughput experiment. Then, we used image-based profiling to
transform the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105">Cell
Painting</a> images into cell morphology data that can be analyzed to identify
phenotypic differences in an unbiased way. Next, we adapted the Variant Impact
Phenotyping (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003022/">VIP</a> and <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009132">VIP2</a>)
algorithm to make predictions using the cell morphology data; we call it cell
morphology-based VIP (cmVIP) .  Finally, we conducted various data analyses to
validate and compare the Cell Painting predictions with transcriptional
profiling (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195078/">L1000</a>).

<p class="flow-text">
We found that Cell Painting reveals insights into the phenotypic
characteristics of cancer variants, which are generally consistent with
transcriptional profiling. We created this website to allow researchers to
explore the predictions and results of most of the analyses performed in our
project. This website is designed to share all the results obtained in the
project in a highly interactive way.
