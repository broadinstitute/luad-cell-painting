<h3>What is this about?</h3>
<p class="flow-text">
The goal of this project was to characterize the phenotypic impact of lung
cancer variants using imaging. We collected Cell Painting images of A549 cells
for 325 overexpression constructs of variants across 50 reference genes in a
high-throughput experiment. Then, we used image-based profiling to transform
the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.105">Cell Painting</a>
images into cell morphology data that can be analyzed to identify phenotypic
differences in an unbiased way. Next, we adapted the Variant Impact Phenotyping
(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003022/">VIP</a> and <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009132">VIP2</a>)
algorithm to make predictions using the cell morphology data; we call it cell
morphology-based VIP (cmVIP) .  Finally, we conducted various data analyses to
validate and compare the Cell Painting predictions with transcriptional
profiling (L1000).

<p class="flow-text">
We found that Cell Painting reveals insights into the phenotypic
characteristics of cancer variants, which are consistent with transcriptional
profiling. We created this website to allow researchers to explore the
predictions and results of most of the analyses performed in our project. This
website is designed to share all the results obtained in the project in a
highly interactive way.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p class="flow-text">
  The 50 reference genes are listed in the left panel of this website. Click
  on one gene to access the list of corresponding variants tested in this
  project.
</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  When clicking on one variant, the cmVIP predictions will appear with links to
  single cell results as well as L1000 (eVIP) results.
